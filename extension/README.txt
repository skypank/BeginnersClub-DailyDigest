Run news_updater.py = needs master.readerslist file to be existing

This will fetch latest news articles from the specified files in masterlist.py
and update the existing master.readerslist file 

This Depends upon :  
1. masterlist.py = contains list of files to be read from database
2. utils.py = for supporting files 
3. scrapper.py = needs database file and cfg file mentioned in masterlist.py

==> master.readerlist will get updated with latest news on server.

master_news_reader = will connect to server and update the local copy of master.readerslist

To include new newspapers site, add database file and cfg file and mention in masterlist.py in this format
files generated by bootscrap_gen5 = filename, filename.cfg
same filename must be updated in masterlist.py
